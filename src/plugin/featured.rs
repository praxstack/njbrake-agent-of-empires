//! The curated / featured plugin index.
//!
//! `plugins/featured.toml` is compiled into the binary and pins a vetted plugin
//! release to its source [`tree_hash`](super::integrity::tree_hash). A featured
//! entry is the maintainer's attestation that this exact tree was reviewed: it
//! is what makes "is this plugin safe" answerable, and it is the only thing
//! that lets a community install claim a reserved (`aoe.*` /
//! `agent-of-empires.*`) namespace. Install and update refuse on a mismatch
//! against the pin.
